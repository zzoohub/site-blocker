# Privacy Policy for Site Blocker

**Last Updated: December 4, 2024**

## Overview

Site Blocker is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how our Chrome extension handles your data.

## Data Collection

**We do NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

Site Blocker:
- Does NOT collect any personal information
- Does NOT track your browsing history
- Does NOT send any data to external servers
- Does NOT use analytics or tracking services
- Does NOT share any information with third parties

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's built-in storage API:

- **Blocked websites list**: Stored locally in your browser's sync storage
- **No other data is collected or stored**

Your blocked websites list is only stored on your device and synced across your Chrome browsers if you're signed into Chrome with sync enabled. This sync is handled entirely by Google Chrome, not by our extension.

## Permissions Usage

Site Blocker requires the following permissions to function:

- **declarativeNetRequest**: To block network requests to websites you've added to your blocked list
- **storage**: To save your list of blocked websites locally on your device
- **tabs**: To detect when you visit a blocked website and redirect you to the blocked page
- **host_permissions (<all_urls>)**: To allow blocking any website you choose to add

These permissions are used solely for the extension's core functionality and not for data collection.

## Third-Party Services

Site Blocker uses Google's favicon service (`https://www.google.com/s2/favicons`) to display website icons. When a blocked page is shown, your browser may request a favicon from Google's servers. This is a standard browser feature and is subject to Google's privacy policy.

No other third-party services are used.

## Children's Privacy

Site Blocker does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. The extension does not collect any personal information from any users.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.

## Contact

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us through the Chrome Web Store support page.

## Your Consent

By using Site Blocker, you consent to this privacy policy.

**Summary**: Site Blocker is a completely private, offline-first extension that stores all data locally on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or sell any of your data.
